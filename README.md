# Benchmarking_exome_sequencing_pipeline

Benchmarking exome pipelines is crucial for evaluating their performance in variant calling and clinical significance annotation. It allows researchers and clinicians to assess accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, identifying the most effective pipelines. In this study, we compared our in-house consensus exome pipeline (https://github.com/prashbio/CONVEX) with the gold standard Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) pipeline using four datasets.  We also performed trio exome analysis using VarScan Trio and GATK joint calling pipelines on our previously published Congenital Pouch Colon (CPC) samples.
