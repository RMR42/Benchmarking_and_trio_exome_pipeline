# Benchmarking_exome_sequencing_pipeline

Benchmarking is a process of comparing the performance of a system or process against a standard or best practice. In whole exome-trio sequencing pipelines, benchmarking can be crucial for identifying errors or biases, thereby improving pipeline performance. One approach is comparing results to high-quality reference data, assessing the impact of varying methods, or evaluating prioritization tools for germline causal variants.

In this project, we performed trio exome analysis using two pipelines: VarScan Trio and GATK joint calling, on Congenital Pouch Colon (CPC) and Prostate Cancer (PCa) samples from our rare disease cohort. We aimed to compare benchmarking results using datasets from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) consortium and a truth set for pipeline performance validation, confirming associations with disease-causing mutations.
